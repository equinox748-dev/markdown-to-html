This project provides a simple, single-page web application to convert and display Markdown files (`.md`) as styled HTML content directly in your browser. It's built with modern web technologies, including Tailwind CSS for responsive styling and Marked.js for efficient Markdown parsing.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Automatically fetches `input.md` and renders its content as HTML.
*   **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS to ensure a great viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
*   **Lightweight and Fast:** A single HTML file with CDN-loaded libraries for quick setup and minimal dependencies.
*   **Customizable Styling:** Easily modify the look and feel by adjusting the Tailwind CSS classes or adding custom styles.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you only need to place the provided `index.html` and your Markdown content (`input.md`) in the same directory.

### Prerequisites

*   A web browser.

### Usage

1.  Save the `index.html` file in a directory.
2.  Place your Markdown file, named `input.md`, in the *same directory* as `index.html`.

The application will automatically fetch `input.md`, convert its content to HTML, and display it on the page.
